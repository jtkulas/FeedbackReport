```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Structure

We're planning three phases of feedback report:

1. static .pdf
2. forgot
3. dynmic dashboard

## Ideas 

We could include "engagement profiles" for individuals to increase response rates 
We could include "engagement profiles at the organizational level, giving them an overview of the type of workforce they have depending on the engagement results 
We could include descriptions of what each category of vigor, absorption, and dedication look like at each level. 

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
