# Structure

We're planning three phases of feedback report:

1. static .pdf
2. forgot
3. dynmic dashboard

## Ideas 

We could include "engagement profiles" for individuals to increase response rates 
We could include "engagement profiles at the organizational level, giving them an overview of the type of workforce they have depending on the engagement results 
We could include descriptions of what each category of vigor, absorption, and dedication look like at each level.
